# Christian Code of Conduct

In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

Open source software is a way for Christian 
software developers to give digital alms to 
those who need it. For the Father wishes that 
from his own gifts there should be given to all.

This document is a code of conduct for Christian
Open source projects.

1. First we shall love God, 
and love our neighbour as ourseves, 
and all things that we do not want to 
be done to us, we will not do to others.

2. We shall honor the Commandments, 
as a sign of our love for God. 
We will avoid  everything that is evil,
and from everything that is like to it.
